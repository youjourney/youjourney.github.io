**[원본 문제](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/6763)**

### 문제 설명

Many communities now have “radar” signs that tell drivers what their speed is, in the hope that they will slow down.

You will output a message for a “radar” sign. The message will display information to a driver based on his/her speed according to the following table:

|km/h over the limit|Fine|
|1 to 20|$100|
|21 to 30|$270|
|31 or above|$500|

### 입력

The input will be two integers. The first line of input will be speed limit. The second line of input will be the recorded speed of the car.

### 출력

If the driver is not speeding, the output should be:

> Congratulations, you are within the speed limit\!

If the driver is speeding, the output should be:

> You are speeding and your fine is $F.

where F is the amount of the fine as described in the table above.

```kotlin
import java.util.Scanner

fun main(args: Array<String>) = println(
    (0..1).asIterable()
        .map { sc.nextInt() }
        .reduce { acc, i -> i - acc }
        .let {
            if (it > 0) {
                when (it) {
                    in 1..20 -> "You are speeding and your fine is \$100."
                    in 21..30 -> "You are speeding and your fine is \$270."
                    else -> "You are speeding and your fine is \$500."
                }
            } else {
                "Congratulations, you are within the speed limit!"
            }
        }
)

val sc = Scanner(System.`in`)
```
