### 문제 설명

Here at the Concerned Citizens of Commerce (CCC), we have noted that telemarketers like to use seven\-digit phone numbers where the last four digits have three properties. Looking just at the last four digits, these properties are:

* the first of these four digits is an 8 or 9;
* the last digit is an 8 or 9;
* the second and third digits are the same.
* For example, if the last four digits of the telephone number are 8229, 8338, or 9008, these are telemarketer numbers.

Write a program to decide if a telephone number is a telemarketer number or not, based on the last four digits. If the number is not a telemarketer number, we should answer the phone, and otherwise, we should ignore it.

### 입력

The input will be 4 lines where each line contains exactly one digit in the range from 0 to 9.

### 출력

Output either ignore if the number matches the pattern for a telemarketer number; otherwise, output answer.

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val sc = Scanner(System.`in`)

    (0..3)
        .map { sc.nextInt() }
        .let {
            if (it[0] in 8..9 && it[3] in 8..9) {
                if (it[1] == it[2]) {
                    println("ignore")
                    return@let
                }
            }
            println("answer")
        }
}
