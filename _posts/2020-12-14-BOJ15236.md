title: "[백준] Dominos (15236)(kotlin)"
excerpt: "Dominoes are gaming pieces used in numerous tile games. Each domino piece contains two marks. Each mark consists of a number of spots (possibly zero). The number of spots depends on the set size. Each mark in a size N domino set can contain between 0 and N spots, inclusive. Two tiles are considered identical if their marks have the same number of spots, regardless of reading order. For example tile with 2 and 8 spot marks is identical to the tile having 8 and 2 spot marks. A proper domino set contains no duplicate tiles. A complete set of size N contains all possible tiles with N or less spots and no duplicate tiles. For example, the complete set of size 2 contains 6 tiles:"

### 문제 설명

Dominoes are gaming pieces used in numerous tile games. Each domino piece contains two marks. Each mark consists of a number of spots (possibly zero). The number of spots depends on the set size. Each mark in a size N domino set can contain between 0 and N spots, inclusive. Two tiles are considered identical if their marks have the same number of spots, regardless of reading order. For example tile with 2 and 8 spot marks is identical to the tile having 8 and 2 spot marks. A proper domino set contains no duplicate tiles. A complete set of size N contains all possible tiles with N or less spots and no duplicate tiles. For example, the complete set of size 2 contains 6 tiles:

Write a program that will determine the total number of spots on all tiles of a complete size N set.

### 입력

The first and only line of input contains a single integer, N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000), the size of the complete set.

### 출력

The first and only line of output should contain a single integer, total number of spots in a complete size N set.

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) = println(
    readLine()!!
        .toInt()
        .let { N ->
            (N * (N + 1) * (N + 2)) / 2
        }
)
